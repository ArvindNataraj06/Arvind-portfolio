# Personal Portfolio – Arvind Nataraj

A modern, responsive, and bilingual personal portfolio website built with **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.
This project highlights my background, technical skills, professional experience, and selected projects in a clean and production-ready format.

## Overview

This portfolio was designed and developed to present my profile in a clear, structured, and professional way, with a focus on frontend best practices and scalability.
It reflects how I approach real-world frontend development: clean architecture, reusable components, and maintainable code.

The application supports **English and German language switching**, making it suitable for the German job market.
